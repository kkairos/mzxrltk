# MegaZeux Roguelike Toolkit:

Because why weren't we making Roguelikes in MZX before?

## basics

* mzx_mzxrltk.mzx - working .mzx file for toolkit
* robot_*name*.txt - plaintext dump of current contents of robot *name* in mzx_mzxrltk.mzx

Thanks to Lancer-X, ThDPro and many others for helping me hone my MZX skills over the years.
