# MegaZeux Roguelike Toolkit:

Because why weren't we making Roguelikes in MZX before?

## basics

* mzx_mzxrltk.mzx - working .mzx file for toolkit
* robot_*name*.txt - plaintext dump of current contents of robot *name* in mzx_mzxrltk.mzx

Thanks to Lancer-X, ThDPro and many others for helping me hone my MZX skills over the years. ThDPro in particular is basically responsible for showing me perhaps the most efficient FOV algorithm that exists in MegaZeux at present. Also Elig whose Roguebasin piece on the matter was the basis of the other algorithm.
